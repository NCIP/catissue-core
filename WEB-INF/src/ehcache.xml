    <!--
    Sets the path to the directory where cache files are created.

    If the path is a Java System Property it is replaced by its value in the
    running VM.

    The following properties are translated:
    * user.home - User's home directory
    * user.dir - User's current working directory
    * java.io.tmpdir - Default temp file path

    Subdirectories can be specified below the property e.g. java.io.tmpdir/one

	 <!-- Cache configuration.

    The following attributes are required.

    name:
    Sets the name of the cache. This is used to identify the cache. It must be unique.

    maxElementsInMemory:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory

    eternal:
    Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal,  timeouts are ignored and the
    element is never expired.

    overflowToDisk:
    Sets whether elements can overflow to disk when the in-memory cache
    has reached the maxInMemory limit.

    The following attributes are optional.

    timeToIdleSeconds:
    Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum amount of time between accesses before an element expires
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that an Element can idle for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    timeToLiveSeconds:
    Sets the time to live for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum time between creation time and when an element expires.
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that and Element can live for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    diskPersistent:
    Whether the disk store persists between restarts of the Virtual Machine.
    The default value is false.

    diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds:
    The number of seconds between runs of the disk expiry thread. The default value
    is 120 seconds.

    memoryStoreEvictionPolicy:
    Policy would be enforced upon reaching the maxElementsInMemory limit. Default
    policy is Least Recently Used (specified as LRU). Other policies available -
    First In First Out (specified as FIFO) and Less Frequently Used
    (specified as LFU)

    Cache elements can also contain sub elements which take the same format of a factory class
    and properties. Defined sub-elements are:

    * cacheEventListenerFactory - Enables registration of listeners for cache events, such as
      put, remove, update, and expire.

    * bootstrapCacheLoaderFactory - Specifies a BootstrapCacheLoader, which is called by a
      cache on initialisation to prepopulate itself.

    Each cache that will be distributed needs to set a cache event listener which replicates
    messages to the other CacheManager peers. For the built-in RMI implementation this is done
    by adding a cacheEventListenerFactory element of type RMICacheReplicatorFactory to each
    distributed cache's configuration as per the following example:

    <cacheEventListenerFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheReplicatorFactory"
         properties="replicateAsynchronously=true,
         replicatePuts=true,
         replicateUpdates=true,
         replicateUpdatesViaCopy=true,
         replicateRemovals=true "/>

    The RMICacheReplicatorFactory recognises the following properties:

    * replicatePuts=true|false - whether new elements placed in a cache are
      replicated to others. Defaults to true.

    * replicateUpdates=true|false - whether new elements which override an
      element already existing with the same key are replicated. Defaults to true.

    * replicateRemovals=true - whether element removals are replicated. Defaults to true.

    * replicateAsynchronously=true | false - whether replications are
      asynchronous (true) or synchronous (false). Defaults to true.

    * replicateUpdatesViaCopy=true | false - whether the new elements are
      copied to other caches (true), or whether a remove message is sent. Defaults to true.

    * asynchronousReplicationIntervalMillis=<number of milliseconds> - The asynchronous
      replicator runs at a set interval of milliseconds. The default is 1000. The minimum
      is 10. This property is only applicable if replicateAsynchronously=true

    The RMIBootstrapCacheLoader bootstraps caches in clusters where RMICacheReplicators are
    used. It is configured as per the following example:

    <bootstrapCacheLoaderFactory
        class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMIBootstrapCacheLoaderFactory"
        properties="bootstrapAsynchronously=true, maximumChunkSizeBytes=5000000"/>

    The RMIBootstrapCacheLoaderFactory recognises the following optional properties:

    * bootstrapAsynchronously=true|false - whether the bootstrap happens in the background
      after the cache has started. If false, bootstrapping must complete before the cache is
      made available. The default value is true.

    * maximumChunkSizeBytes=<integer> - Caches can potentially be very large, larger than the
      memory limits of the VM. This property allows the bootstraper to fetched elements in
      chunks. The default chunk size is 5000000 (5MB).

    This cache has a maximum of 1000 elements in memory. There is no overflow to disk, so 1000

    timeToIdle are not used and do not need to be specified.
