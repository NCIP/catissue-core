Dear OpenSpecimen Administrator,

	This is to validate that OpenSpecimen application has been installed at the following location: ${jboss.home.dir}
	To complete the deployment, you have to now perform the post installation steps described in section "Post Installation Configuration" in the deployment guide.
	Once you have completed deployment, you should be able to login with the following details:
	URL: ${protocol}://${jbossServerHost}:${jboss.server.port}/openspecimen
	Username:${first.admin.emailAddress}
	Password:${first.admin.password}

Thanking You,
